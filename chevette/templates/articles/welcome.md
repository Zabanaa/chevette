title: Ronaldo through the middle or Dybala as a false nine? How Juventus will line up in 2019-20

---

## Goalkeepers
Replacing the pragmatic Massimiliano Allegri with a self-confessed "dreamer"
like Sarri created enough intrigue as it was, without the unexpected and unwelcome
concerns over the latter's health.

However, it is the club's attempts to put together a squad capable of winning
the Champions League that is really responsible for the sense of unease among
Juve fans right now.

As we'll outline below, the Bianconeri have been busy this summer, but not busy
enough, as sporting director Fabio Paratici still needs to offload a number of
big names before the close of the transfer window in order to balance the books.

Consequently, Juve are likely to begin their bid for a ninth consecutive
Scudetto with players that could well be sold before matchday two, which only
adds to the cloud of confusion hanging over a club that have for so many years
been synonymous with stability and sensibility.

An interesting season lies ahead for everyone involved...

## Midfielders

Juventus have long been regarded as the masters of the free transfer and
they've reminded everyone of precisely why by picking up both Aaron Ramsey
and Adrien Rabiot for nothing (if we exclude wages and signing-on fees!)
this summer.

Both should go straight into the starting line-up, as Ramsey is the kind of
goal-scoring midfielder the Old Lady has been lacking for years, while Rabiot,
for all the concerns about his temperament, is an immensely talented player
with the requisite mix of physique and technique to belatedly
replace fellow Frenchman Paul Pogba.

**Miralem Pjanic** will be again charged with pulling the strings in the middle of
the park, despite ongoing concerns over his efficacy in the biggest games.

**Emre Can** is obviously a viable alternative, after impressing all and sundry
with his drive and versatility last term, but the perception remains that the
Germany international is not as good as he thinks and will never be anything
other than a useful utility player.

**Rodrigo Bentancur**, meanwhile, has shown plenty of promise and is still
improving. The same cannot be said of **Blaise Matuidi** and **Sami Khedira**,
both of whom are 32 and very clearly in decline. The pair have undeniably served
the Old Lady well but that both are still at the club is surprising.
